# Hypothesis_Testing

The Aim of this project is to successfully test the given statistical hypothesis and conclude if we will accept or reject the null hypothesis

Python Modules used- 
  - Regex
  - Natural language Toolkit
  - Pandas (To extract critical value from table)

Plan to get this Done 
1. Extracting the data like- 
   - Standard deviation of popullation
   - standard deviation of sample
   - sample size
   - Given alpha value
2. Getting the critical t/z/chi-squarred value from the extracted data (mainly alpha value)
3. Creating functions for each test to get calculated t/z/chi-squarred value
4. comparing critical and calculated value, defining some more conditions in order to get the final conclusion

## Here the main work of NLP is in step one, That's where I am getting strucked.

## All the patterns and chunks are formed based on the training questions in the attached pdf file
